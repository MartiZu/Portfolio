        I started travelling with my parents as a child, developing a passion for exploring new places and cultures. I love to try new food, learn new languages and meet local people during my trips.

        When I am not around, you can probably find me planning my next trip, or maybe sitting on a plan aheading to some exciting destination. But my life is more than just travelling, I also love to cook and bake, especially for my friends and family.
